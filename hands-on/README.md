# Hands-On Session

This folder contains all the necessary files and resources for the hands-on session. Each file and subfolder is organized to guide you through the practical exercises step by step.

Please refer to the individual README.md files or instructions within the subfolders for detailed guidance on each exercise.

Start with the [01-setup](./01-setup) folder to begin your hands-on experience. Each subsequent folder will build upon the previous one, leading you through the process of creating and testing your own agent.
